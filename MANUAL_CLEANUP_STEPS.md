## ðŸ“‹ MANUAL CLEANUP STEPS

After running `cleanup-old-aggregation.bat`, you need to manually update these files:

### 1. Update `app/(tabs)/admin.tsx`

**Remove these lines:**
```typescript
import { AggregationManagement } from '@/components/admin/AggregationManagement';

// In the switch statement, remove:
case 'aggregation':
  return <AggregationManagement />;
```

**Remove the aggregation tab from the navigation** (look for where tabs are defined)

### 2. Check `api/` folder
Look for any folders named:
- `api/aggregation/`
- `api/pipeline/`

And delete them if they exist.

### 3. Verify Cleanup
After running the cleanup script, these should be gone:
- âœ… `app/admin/aggregation/` (entire folder)
- âœ… `components/admin/AggregationManagement.tsx`
- âœ… All old aggregation services
- âœ… All old setup scripts

### 4. Test Your App
Make sure your app still runs without errors after removing the aggregation components.

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT: Create New Simple System

Once cleanup is complete, I'll create:
1. **Simple Competitor Research Service** - Scrapes competitors
2. **Simple Deal Review UI** - Super admin approves deals  
3. **Simple API** - Just what we need

Much cleaner and focused! ðŸš€
