# Image Display Information

## Current Implementation

Your app **already displays images directly from URLs** without uploading them to your server. Here's how it works:

### In Deal Cards (`components/DealCard.tsx`):
```tsx
<Image source={{ uri: deal.image }} style={styles.image} />
```

### In Enhanced Deal Cards (`components/EnhancedDealCardV2.tsx`):
```tsx
<Image 
  source={{ uri: deal.images?.[0] || 'https://placehold.co/400x160/e2e8f0/64748b?text=No+Image' }}
  style={styles.dealImage}
/>
```

### In Deal Details (`app/deal-details.tsx`):
```tsx
<ImageBackground 
  source={{ uri: selectedImage || 'https://placehold.co/600x400' }} 
  style={styles.headerImageBackground}
>
```

## Benefits of Current Approach

1. **No Storage Costs**: Images are served directly from their original URLs
2. **Faster Loading**: No need to upload and then download from your server
3. **Bandwidth Savings**: Your server doesn't handle image traffic
4. **Real-time Updates**: If the source updates their image, it's automatically reflected

## Fallback Images

The app uses placeholder images when the original image fails to load:
- `https://placehold.co/400x160/e2e8f0/64748b?text=No+Image`
- `https://images.pexels.com/photos/3394650/pexels-photo-3394650.jpeg`

## Image Validation

The `storageService.ts` includes URL validation to ensure safe image sources and block private/internal IPs.

## Recommendation

âœ… **Your current implementation is optimal!** There's no need to change the image handling system.
